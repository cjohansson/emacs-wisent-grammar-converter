# Emacs Wisent Grammar Converter

As a first goal this project is about creating Elisp functions that convert Yacc parser-generator grammar into Wisent. In the future maybe more parser generator grammars could be supported as well.

## The problem

I was about creating a Emacs PHP mode with full semantic support and there is a YACC grammar available, I needed to convert this to Wisent but I dreaded the idea of having to do it manually so I started working on this. 

After a while I though maybe other people could find this useful as well so I started this project.
